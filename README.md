# My sources of inspiration
 - [Mathias Bynens's dotfiles repo](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) for setting up files fixtures
 - [Jake Romer article](https://coderwall.com/p/pn8f0g/show-your-git-status-and-branch-in-color-at-the-command-prompt) for the base of bash_prompt customization code
